# Scientific Research Project

## üß† Overview

This project is part of a scientific research initiative aimed at studying the performance improvement when using ensemble models compared to individual machine learning models. The goal is to explore how model combination techniques such as stacking can enhance prediction accuracy in real-world data.

This project is still being updated. Future directions include:

- Building a web application to integrate the trained models for real-time prediction.

- Exploring newer and more advanced machine learning models.

- Expanding the dataset and analysis scope beyond Hanoi to other provinces across Vietnam.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Code_Crawl_Data/`: Scripts using `HttpRequest` and `Selenium` to crawl raw data.
- `Code_Clean_Data/`: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `Code_Data_Mining/`: Initial data exploration and feature engineering.
- `Code_Train_Model/`: Training various machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) and stacking them.
- `Dataset/`: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `Output_Model/`: Exported models and submission CSVs.
- `Report/`: Project documents, including final report and topic description.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, joblib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Selenium, Requests
- Git, Google Colab

## üöÄ Model Approach

The project experiments with several machine learning models:
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **XGBoost (XGB)**
- Final models are combined using **model stacking** for better performance.
